## Picture Search

Using the Unsplash API and React, you will write an application that allows users to search the unsplash API for photos and display the results.

### Requirements

- To search photos from Unsplash, you'll need to use this [endpoint](https://unsplash.com/documentation#search-photos
)
- Users can type their search query into a input box
- Users can select from a drop-down, how many photos they would like displayed on the page (5,10 or 15)
- Users can select what type of orientation of photo they would like (landscape, portrait, and squarish or all [`all` is actually default, so consider this when your writing your app])
- Once a user hits search, the app will query the unsplash API and return photos that match the search criteria.
- When your app loads up, it will grab and display a random photo as a small avatar in the top left corner of your app. It should use this [endpoint](https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo)
